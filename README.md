# 🐍 Python Crash Course Practice

This repository is dedicated to my practice work from **_Python Crash Course_** by Eric Matthes. Here, I’m working through exercises and projects to reinforce Python fundamentals and build hands-on coding experience.

## 📖 About
*Python Crash Course* is a beginner-friendly book that covers essential Python concepts and practical programming skills. This repository documents my progress through the book, including:
- Exercises that focus on individual Python concepts
- Mini-projects that bring these concepts together
- Personal notes and any additional resources I find helpful

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into sections that follow the book’s chapters:
- **`basics/`** – Python basics like syntax, data types, and control flow.
- **`functions/`** – Practice with functions, parameters, return values, and scope.
- **`classes/`** – Introduction to object-oriented programming with classes and instances.
- **`files/`** – File I/O for reading and writing data.
- **`projects/`** – Larger projects that combine skills from multiple chapters.

## 🚀 Goals
By practicing with this repository, I aim to:
- Develop a solid understanding of Python programming.
- Apply programming skills to solve problems.
- Build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my progress.

## 📌 Note
This repository is for personal study, practice, and growth in Python programming based on *Python Crash Course*. Feel free to explore, use, or adapt any of the examples if you’re also learning Python!
